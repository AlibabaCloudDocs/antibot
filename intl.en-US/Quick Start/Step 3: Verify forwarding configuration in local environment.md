# Step 3: Verify forwarding configuration in local environment {#concept_um4_k5s_l2b .concept}

Before you switch all business traffic to the Anti-Bot instance, we recommend that you verify that the domain configuration works properly and the Anti-Bot instance forwards requests as expected. The local environment verification process requires to locally simulate access to the Anti-Bot instance. Then, visit the protected website to verify that the Anti-Bot instance forwards the requests properly.

## Locally simulate access to Anti-Bot {#section_hfv_n5s_l2b .section}

Simulate access to the Anti-Bot instance by modifying the hosts file \([What is the hosts file](http://baike.baidu.com/link?url=xM2xPdn2qHt8n_kNP1aAGnCisAMq1y54ewyeGVH7x5lqmZG05Zw2Tr63IiWNs8VAOp-QCRwd9ZWx4wZSiB6QW_KU1GvUr7ojjuXXa3SXYGdfvQhZuB73nzM9zxe6keoSdbOe04Eh1hn2KCNC1lcIo4QyyT7efhbUwpKTe_oh2OW)\) in local environment. Then,Â  requests to the protected site from the local environment are resolved to the Anti-Bot instance. For example, follow these steps to modify the hosts file in a local Windows operating system based client:

1.  Open the hosts file by using a text editor tool, such as NotePad or Notepad ++. The hosts file is typically located in the `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\` file folder.
2.  Add the following text on the last line in the hosts file: `[IP of the Anti-Bot instance] [Protected domain name]`.

    For example, modify the hosts file for the `www.aliyundemo.cn` domain. Assume that this domain has been configured in the Anti-Bot instance as [Step 1: add domain configuration](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Step 1: Add a domain.md#), and the following CNAME record is assigned for the domain: `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.alicloudwaf.com`

    1.  Run the `ping xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.alicloudwaf.com` command in Command Prompt in your local Windows client to obtain the assigned IP of the Anti-Bot instance. Then, you can get the IP of the Anti-Bot instance that protects your website domain from the response result.

    2.  Add the following line in the hosts file. In the line, the previous IP address is the IP of the Anti-Bot instance that obtained in the previous step, and the domain name that follows is the website domain name that is protected.

3.  Save the hosts file. Then, ping the protected website domain locally.

    Now, the website domain is resolved to the IP address of the Anti-Bot instance that you just added in the hosts file. If it still resolves to the IP address of the origin server, refresh your local DNS cache by running the `ipconfig /flushdns` command in Command Prompt in the Windows client.


## Verify that Anti-Bot forwards requests properly {#section_n1k_lws_l2b .section}

After you confirm that the modification in the hosts file works \(the website domain is resolved to the IP of the Anti-Bot instance locally\), open a web browser and visit the website domain. If the website can be visited as expected, the domain configuration for the website domain in Anti-Bot is correct.

After the above verification process is passed, see [Step 4: Modify the DNS resolution](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Step 4: Modify DNS resolution.md#) to switch business traffic to Anti-Bot.
