# Deploy both Anti-Bot and CDN {#concept_ig2_xfj_p2b .concept}

Anti-Bot Service \(Anti-Bot\) can be deployed with CDN \(such as Wangsu, Jiasule, Qiniu, Youpai, and Alibaba Cloud CDN\) to protect CDN-enabled content against malicious bot traffic. You can deploy both Anti-Bot and CDN for your origin server in this schema: CDN \(ingress to content acceleration\) \> Anti-Bot \(intermediate layer for application-layer protection\) \> origin server.

## Use Alibaba Cloud CDN {#section_qnf_dhj_p2b .section}

Here, Alibaba Cloud CDN is used as an example. Perform the following steps to deploy both Anti-Bot and CDN for your website:

1.  Configure CDN for the \(accelerating\) domain name to be protected based on [CDN quick start](../../intl.en-US/Quick Start/Quick start.md#).
2.  Create website configuration in the Anti-Bot console.

    -   **Domain**: Enter the domain name that you want to protect.
    -   **Server Address**: Enter the public IP address of an SLB instance, the public IP address of an ECS instance, or the IP address of a server in an IDC.
    -   **Layer-7 gateways are in use, such as Alibaba Cloud Anti-DDoS Pro or CDN**: Select **Yes**.
    For more information, see [Add domain name configuration](../intl.en-US/Quick Start/Step 1: Add a domain.md#).

3.  After the website configuration is created, Anti-Bot generates a dedicated CNAME address for the domain name.

    **Note:** For how to check the CNAME address generated by Anti-Bot, see [Check the CNAME address allocated by Anti-Bot](../intl.en-US/Quick Start/Step 1: Add a domain.md#section_uvb_gnv_fgb).

4.  Perform the following step to change the origin server address in CDN configuration to the CNAME address allocated by Anti-Bot:
    1.  Log on to the [Alibaba Cloud CDN console](https://cdn.console.aliyun.com/#/DomainList/list).
    2.  On the Domain Configuration page, select the target domain name and click **Configure**.
    3.  Click **Edit Origin IP** under **Origin Edit**.
    4.  Modify the origin server information.

        -   **Type**: Select **Origin Site Domain**.
        -   **Origin Site Domain**: Enter the CNAME address generated by Anti-Bot.
        -   **Use the same protocol as the back-to-origin protocol**: Enable this option.

    5.  Confirm that **Back-to-Origin Host** is disabled under **Back-to-Origin Configuration**.

After the preceding configuration, traffic passes through CDN, and dynamic content is detected and protected by Anti-Bot.
