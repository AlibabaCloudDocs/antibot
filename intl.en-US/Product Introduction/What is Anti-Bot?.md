# What is Anti-Bot? {#concept_w31_hns_l2b .concept}

Alibaba Cloud Security Anti-Bot Service \(Anti-Bot\) is a web application security service that effectively detects and identifies Web crawlers. It reduces the impact of Web crawlers and automation tools on your company's website.

Anti-Bot provides a comprehensive security solution to defend against malicious bot traffic for your Web, app or API services. This eliminates weaknesses in the security of your business applications.

After you purchase Anti-Bot Service, you must configure a forwarding rule for your website in the Anti-Bot Service console and resolve the domain name of your website to a CNAME record provided by your Anti-Bot instance. All of your website's traffic then first passes through your Anti-Bot instance, which detects and filters out malicious traffic. Only the clean traffic is forwarded to the origin servers of your website, protecting you from security risks, such as data leakage and business fraud.
