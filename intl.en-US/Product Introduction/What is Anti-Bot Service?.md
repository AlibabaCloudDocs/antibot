Alibaba Cloud Security Anti-Bot Service \(Anti-Bot\) is a web application security service that can effectively detect and identify web crawlers. Then, it can help you to reduce the impact of web crawlers and automation tools on your website business.

Anti-Bot Service provides a comprehensive security solution to defend against malicious bot traffic for your web, APP or API services. This ensures that the application security of your business has no weakness in any part.

After purchasing Anti-Bot Service, the protection gets effective once you configure a forwarding rule for your website in the Anti-Bot Service console and resolve the domain name of your website to a CNAME record provided by your Anti-Bot instance.Â  Then, all of your website's traffic passes through your Anti-Bot instance firstly, and all malicious bot traffic is detected and filtered by the Anti-Bot cloud service. Eventually, Anti-Bot only forwards clean traffic back to origin servers of your website. This ensures that your origin servers are protected against security issues, such as data leakage and business fraud, caused by malicious bot traffic.
