# Increase the limit on domains {#concept_zsf_cvd_n2b .concept}

## Domains {#section_pbn_cvd_n2b .section}

By default, one Anti-Bot instance supports up to 10 domains. You can only add one TLD and up to 9 subdomains or wildcard domains for protection.

For example, you can add `abc.com` as the TLD and up to 9 subdomains or wildcard domains, such as `www.abc.com`, `\*.abc.com`, `mail.abc.com`, `user.pay.abc.com`, and `x.y.z.abc.com`. The total number of domains, including the `abc.com` TLD, cannot exceed 10.

## Increase the limit on domains {#section_rbn_cvd_n2b .section}

If you want your Anti-Bot instance to protect two TLDs or their subdomains, you need to pay additional fees. Assume that you have added `abc.com` or its subdomains for protection, the following message appears when you try to add `xyz.com` or its subdomains to the same Anti-Bot instance:

```
You must upgrade your instance to enable protection for more TLDs or their subdomains.
```

In this case, you need to upgrade your Anti-Bot instance to increase the limit on domains.

You can click Upgrade in the Anti-Bot Service console to upgrade your Anti-Bot instance.
